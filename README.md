Mise en place(everything in its place)

File Organization as it pertains to Nick(our sage git master)
1) If a program creates multiple files, only push the ones ones that are needed for others to use the program (i.e. don't push things like log files)
2) If a program has multiple files, create a folder dedicated to them in the correct spot, ask if you're not sure what the spot is (i.e. if projectlibre has a project file and an image/pdf, create a folder in documentation called "Gantt Chart"
3) Do not keep previous revisions, git does that for us. You can tag the commit of the previous version if you feel inspired (i.e. don't have something like schematic_v1, schematic_v2, shematic_v3. It should just have shematic)
4) If you're not sure what to do, ASK
